Slack used to be the scrappy startup and seemed like a low cost choice to keep in touch. Over the years it has become a massive line item on each of their large customers budgets. It is the same story with many SaaS products companies rely on to operate. Chamath Palihapitiya, a VC and co-host on the All-In podcast, started an "incubator" that aims to solve this issue with "AI". They are calling it 8090 Solutions ([8090.inc](https://www.8090.inc/)) in 2024. Chamath claims it will deliver **80% feature complete software for a 90% reduction in price**. Sounds like a great solution to balance the per seat budget creep of Slack et al. right?

Getting an 80% feature complete Slack for a 90% discount sounds great. But I don't think that 8090 as it is envisioned will work. Chamath seems to be assuming if you can offer the same thing for a cheaper price you can make a killing. Step 1: Make something for cheaper Step 2: ? Step 3: Profit. What could go wrong?

Let's step back and try to understand what this type of business model will do for the entire ecosystem of software development. I'm still skeptical of the initial claim of 90% cheaper software enabled by AI, but let's assume that's true. If making software is 90% cheaper, then you can make 10X the amount of software. This is a *significant* market change. I came up with a few different ways software development might change given this efficiency gain. 

## Million SaaS Blooming Future

If AI enabled software developers can put out 10X the software, we might see a million SaaS startups blooming. Due to increased competition, each will be smaller than the unicorns of the Web 2.0/ZIRP era. Additionally, these SaaS products will be highly differentiated compared to SaaS today. Most businesses would be able to find a software that matches their exact needs, rather than conforming to the processes of the software. 

In this future, you can state your needs and someone in the market probably made it. Maybe as a side project, and maybe it is part of a portfolio of SaaS that the developer has built.

## Customized Future

If AI enabled software developers can put out 10X the software, we might see that customization becomes an expected part of any SaaS. Rather than having
